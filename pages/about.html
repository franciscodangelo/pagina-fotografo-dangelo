                <p>My name is Francisco Gabriel D'Angelo, I was born in the city of Neuquén Capital on 10/15/1987, the city where I lived until I was 18 years old. At that age I traveled to the city of Córdoba Capital to start my studies in Industrial Engineering at the UNC, after a few years I came into contact with my first camera and a year after this event I decided to change the course of my training and join CEF center of photographic studies to carry out the photography career, in 2017 I received; Until today I continue with my academic training related to photography, image and art, and I currently dedicate myself to photography professionally, to teaching and artistic production.</p>

                    <p>In this exhibition you can see the works carried out in the street by the author between January and March 2021. A compilation that oscillates between the portrait, the street, the characters, and the sculptures that are generated by chance in different places of the city. city. a multidisciplinary way of being able to observe what surrounds us

                    <p>Alone, in front of the computer, with camera in hand, at the desk and the lights off, I began to walk, daily, for hours on Google streetview streets and to photograph cutouts of the images that were presented in front of me, I began replicating my usual routes , on the way to work, to the supermarket, to the kiosk, but then I began to expand my routes until they had no limits, only those that the platform itself contained.</p>

                    <p>Project that I start facing the impossibility of leaving the apartment, during two months of pandemic in phase 1. Being a Photographer whose production is largely urban/street, the current extraordinary situation forced me to look for other means to "move" and photograph, to channel that drive that was cut short by the circumstances of confinement and total isolation.</p>

                    <p>In this exhibition i show percentage of my work that feeds on the symbols and materialities of the street, not only as a compulsive photographic record of what is presented to me, but also transcends conceptual and aesthetic inquiries that are represented in other works. The works are also born from questions about myself and personal concerns, attempts to answer or representations of the same questions. binding lines could be degradation, deterioration, appropriation, error, glitch, putrefaction, visualizing everything in a future time from now, time, disappearance.</p>
